Games of strategy have always played a major role in human culture, and as such they have been a focus of the artificial intelligence field from its very beginning. While methods aided by deep learning have recently emerged, the main component of most strong AI game playing programs is an adversarial tree search algorithm. These algorihtms are broad and varied, and though many mixed algorithms that combine several others exist, no unified framework has been developed to describe them as a group. This paper proposes the Extended General Tree Search (EGTS) framework, and successfully implements a wide class of MiniMax- and MCTS-derived algorihtms using it. The agents are compared in Connect Four and Nim, and it is also shown that the framework generalizes to non-adversarial tree search as well. It is concluded that while EGTS describes a broad class of search algorithms and improves the ease of implementation and experimentation, there is still potential to both simplify its representation and extend its functionality.
