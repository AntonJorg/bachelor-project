\section*{Project description}

This project aims to unify the MiniMax and Monte Carlo Tree Search
algoithms by defining a class of algorithms from which they both 
inherit, along with a new algorithm belonging to this class. The
purpose of the new algorithm is not to outperform the others,
but to provide new insights about them.
